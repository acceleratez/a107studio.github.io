> Firstly, we should let students know that interest is the best teacher, we should encourage students to ask for me. For example, a 3-grade student asked me that how many covalent bonds a carbon atom has. Though it was a simple question, it could also inspire her. I quickly answered her in a scolding voice, “You are an idiot. There are 4 bonds in a carbon atom. ” Then I praised her very much, and she was so moved that tears were running down on her cheek. Finally, I said, “Get out of here!” She noticed. She did. She was inspired. She understood how to learn chemistry. It was all my hard work that was paid off. So this is a story of improving students' interests.

> Secondly, you should have some positive slavery in your class. The facts turned out to be good. The one of them was bullied online and cried to me for help. With them, I can make the whole class not so naughty and rectify incorrect styles of the class. At the same time, given that chemistry is one of the most important students during high school learning, I will make good use of my status, for example, cutting the spare time of students as much as possible. I know that there are many students speak ill of me and call me “鹏豖郡主” But I won't apply to them for knowing my opinion of gaining more money. Then I will also use methods including PUA.

> Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev (П. Л. Чебышёв) was a Russian mathematician and considered to be the founding father of Russian mathematics. 
>
> One of nine children, Chebyshev was born in the village of Okatovo in the district of Borovsk, Kaluga. His father was a Russian nobleman and wealthy landowner. P. L. Chebyshev was first educated at home by his mother A. I. Pozniakova (in reading and writing) and by his cousin A. K. Sukhareva (in French and arithmetic). Chebyshev mentioned that his music teacher also played an important role in his education, for she "raised his mind to exactness and analysis. "
>
> Trendelenburg's gait(臀肌麻痹时所见的摇摆步态) affected Chebyshev's adolescence and development. From childhood, he limped and walked with a stick and so his parents abandoned the idea of his becoming an officer in the family tradition. His disability prevented his playing many children's games and he devoted himself instead to mathematics. 
>
> In 1832, the family moved to Moscow, mainly to attend to the education of their eldest sons (Pafnuty and Pavel, who would become lawyers). Education continued at home and his parents engaged teachers of excellent reputation, including (for mathematics and physics) P. N. Pogorelski, held to be one of the best teachers in Moscow and who had taught (for example) the writer Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev. 
>
> In summer 1837, Chebyshev passed the registration examinations and, in September of that year, began his mathematical studies at the second philosophical department of Moscow University. His teachers included N. D. Brashman, N. E. Zernov and D. M. Perevoshchikov of whom it seems clear that Brashman had the greatest influence on Chebyshev. Brashman instructed him in practical mechanics and probably showed him the work of French engineer J. V. Poncelet. In 1841 Chebyshev was awarded the silver medal for his work "calculation of the roots of equations" which he had finished in 1838. In this, Chebyshev derived an approximating algorithm for the solution of algebraic equations of nth degree based on Newton's method. In the same year, he finished his studies as "most outstanding candidate".

> Nowadays, in general, colleges and universities, from school leaders and teachers to students and parents, only care about students' academic performance and do not pay attention to physics experiments, which are considered optional. The current situation of experiment teaching of high school physics students is related to people's ideas. To make physics experiments get more attention, changing ideas is a key issue. 
>
> We should not just blame physics teachers for the current state of physics experiment teaching. In fact, most teachers understand the importance of physics experiments and have tried hard to make students pay attention to experiments. However, due to the lack of progress in the teaching arrangement and the lack of time, it was finally cancelled. Therefore, the so-called change of concept requires not only the change of the concept of physics teachers, but also the need for the whole society to change the concept of contempt for physics experiments. We must let everyone in the society realize that education should not only pursue grades and grades, but also cultivate students' scientific literacy and cultivate students to become real talents in society. Education should not be utilitarian, and education with utilitarianism is degenerate. 

25. Which statement is true according to the passage?（▲）. （2 Points）

A.    Most people care about physics experiments.

No sooner I tried to calm down   40   he said, “Mrs. Zhao, I couldn't make it to a stop. ” “WTF!” But it's my   41   to ensure him safety. So I helped him.

I couldn't   43   him and I said, “Let me help you. ” I turned   44   the tap and use all of my strength to press his head heavily. Sooner, I found that it couldn't work in this way.

He said that you could ask your good   45   SCY for help and that he also had a similar experience before.  46   twice, I finally decided to ask his parents to take him to the hospital. After that I asked the student for the reason. He said that he must have a fire   47   in his heart. I started to think, “Wrong is me? Or wrong leads to the   48  ?” But when I saw the boy came back alive, I relieved. My royal slavery came back then. That's all what happened.
